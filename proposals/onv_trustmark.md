## Project Name
Open Voice Network TrustMark Initiative Project

## Requested Project Maturity Level
Incubation

## Project Description
The Open Voice TrustMark Initiative Project seeks to identify and define the time-honored ethical principles most relevant to the present and future of conversational artificial intelligence, and to translate said principles into individual and organizational endorsement, education, organizational assessment and evaluation, and technical specifications.

In short, the TrustMark Initiative – in an openly-collaborative, vendor-neutral, manner, with global participation – seeks to turn good intentions into action on behalf of users, organizations, and societies.  It seeks to make the conversational AI of today and tomorrow *worthy of user trust*

Since its founding in Q1 2023 from the Ethical Use Task Force of the Open Voice Network, a Linux Foundation community, the TrustMark Initiative Project has published an online “Ethical Principles for Conversational AI” course on the Linux Foundation EdX platform, and is expected in Q4 2023 to publish an organizational ethical self-assessment tool. Its 2024 roadmap points to expansion of its education course development efforts (a next-step course planned in Q1) and globalization/localization by language of its Self-Assessment Tool (also planned Q1).

The TrustMark Initiative has also served as a point of connection within the conversational AI ecosystem, and as a public voice on the topic of ethical conversational AI.  Since 2021

TrustMark leaders have participated in or led the following events
*Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, “Voice Tech Symposium: Consent, Transparency, and Trust, Seattle, March 2023 (keynote speaker)
*Project Voice 2023 Generative AI Leadership Council, March 2023, Chattanooga, TN (leadership and content)
*HIMSS 2023 (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society) Voice/Conversational AI and Healthcare (panelist)
*Voice and AI Conference, Washington, D.C., “Risk Mitigation for Conversational AI,” September 2023 (organizer, keynote speaker)
*Congressional Hackathon 5.0, Washington, DC September 2023 (invited participant)
*Data Privacy 2023, Washington, DC, September 2023 (invited participant)


And the TrustMark Initiative, and its precursor, the Ethical Use Task Force of the Open Voice Network, has issued formal comment to 
*European Data Protection Board Guidelines 02/2021 on Virtual Voice Assistants
*FTC Advanced Rulemaking on Commercial Surveillance and Data Security Practices
*FCC Advanced Rulemaking on CyberSecurity Labeling Program for Smart Devices
*NIST Generative AI Public Working Group 

In addition, the TrustMark Initiative Project – based upon prior research on conversational AI privacy, security, and synthetic voice (https://openvoicenetwork.org/publications/) advises the Open Voice Network Interoperability Project on technical requirements for privacy, security, and synthetic voice (including such issues as assistant authentication, liveness detection, protection of user and organizational data, and interoperable system data security.) These will be developed as specifications for the universal API, or “Message Envelope” now under development by the Interoperability Project.

The TrustMark Initiative Project works at the intersection of natural language AI (processing, understanding, generation), language model generative AI, and the current research and regulation regarding ethical AI. According to Precedence Research (Sept., 2023), this "conversational AI" market will grow at a 23.9% CAGR to a total available global market worth $86.4 billion (USD) by 2032.  

The Project emerged from 2017-2018 research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID Center, Capgemini Consulting, and the Intel Corporation, and a non-profit effort for ethical AI-enabled voice initiated by Project Voice, a Birmingham, Alabama-based organization.  As noted above, it was given its brand identity in Q1 2023, as a stand-alone project within the Open Voice Network, (https://openvoicenetwork.org), a Linux Foundation community founded in 2020.


## Alignment with LF AI & Data Foundation's Mission
As noted above, the Open Voice Network TrustMark Initiative Project seeks to translate time-honored ethical use principles that are specific to the emerging world of conversational AI into endorsement, education, policies and practices, and technical specifications.

It is expected to complement and support current LF AI & Data Foundation efforts in Trusted and Responsible AI, as well as the new Generative AI Commons. 

## Possible Collaboration Opportunities with Current LF AI Hosted Projects
The Open Voice Network TrustMark Initiative Project sees numerous potential collaboration opportunities with current LF AI & Data hosted projects.  These include
* Adversarial Robustness Toolkit (security standards and tools)
* AI Explainability 360
* AI Fairness 360
* Delta (natural language and speech processing platform)
* The AI Frameworks workstream of the Generative AI Commons
* The Education/Outreach workstream of the Generative AI Commons
